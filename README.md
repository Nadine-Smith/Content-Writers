# Content Writing Champs

80% of content writers deep down want to make and grow their own blogs, right?
## BUT THEY FAIL, WHYYY???
Because they think Content is the only thing required in building successful websites/blogs and they invest a lot of time in building these blogs that will end up with almost ZERO Revenue...
The SOLUTION?
Clear your mind that content is just one card of the game and you still need good SEO or SMM skills for making any revenue out of that BLOG...
The best Way: Instead of wasting your time, Make partnerships with people who know good SEO and have a track record of building assets and then go 50-50 with them. This way you will learn a lot and definitely, your blogs will end up with revenues.
And USE your valuable time in serving FAT clients for making the most out of your time
